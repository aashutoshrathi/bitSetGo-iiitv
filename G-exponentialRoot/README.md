# G - Exponential Root

## Problem Statement

yo and lo are best friends and they love maths, their teacher gave them a problem to find a digital root. He gave an integer number A to yo and another integer B to lo.

yo and lo are asked to work together and find the digital root of A<sup>B</sum>.

**PS:** A digital root of a number is sum of all digits in it until we get a single digit.

The digital root of 5674 is same as the digital root of 5 + 6 + 7 + 4 = 22 
and the digital root of 22 is 2 + 2 = 4, so the digital root of 5674 is 4.

## Input Format

- First line contains an integer A, denoting number given to yo.
- Second line contains an integer B, denoting number given to lo.

## Constraints

 *	1 &le; A &le; 10<sup>10<sup>5</sup></sup>
 *	1 &le; B &le; 10<sup>10<sup>5</sup></sup>

## Output Format

Print the digital root of A<sup>B</sup>.

## Editorial

The constraints are obviously a sign that one should get their hands dirty.
We use few properties here:

1. DigitalRoot(X) = X%9
2. DigitalRoot(9<sup>X</sup>) = 9
3. DigitalRoot(3<sup>X</sup>) = 3 if X == 1 else it is 9.
4. DigitalRoot(a<sup>X</sup>) follows a pattern that has a cycle of 6 for rest.

That's all! ðŸ˜‰
